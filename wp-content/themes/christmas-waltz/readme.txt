The Christmas Waltz Theme captures the spirit of a modern Christmas. Light blues give it a cool wintery feel, accented by the warm colors of traditional Christmas symbols such as a decorated tree, mistletoe and, of course, Santa Claus.

The Christmas Waltz Theem is free, but please don't remove the link from the footer. Thank you- and Merry Christmas!
